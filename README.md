# E-Commerce Sales & Views Analysis

This project involves analyzing sales and glance views data for brands like Kelloggs, Logitech, and Kimberly Clark. The objective is to provide actionable insights to help these brands grow their e-commerce revenue on Amazon and other retailers.

## Project Overview

This analysis focuses on understanding key metrics such as ordered revenue, units sold, and rep out-of-stock (OOS) occurrences, alongside trends and relationships between sales data and glance views. The analysis helps uncover patterns in sales performance and customer engagement, guiding decisions for future e-commerce growth strategies.

### Key Objectives:

Provide insights into ordered revenue and units sold over time.

Analyze the correlation between views and units sold.

Highlight the top SKUs contributing to revenue.

Explore trends by category to identify high-performing areas.

Offer recommendations for improving e-commerce revenue.

### Datasets

The project uses two main datasets:

Sales Data: Contains details about ordered revenue, ordered units, SKU names, and feed dates.

Glance Views Data: Contains views data and SKU information to analyze customer engagement and conversion.

### Tools & Technologies

Python: For data cleaning, merging, and analysis.

SQL: Mandatory requirement for data extraction and manipulation.

Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

### Key Insights

Ordered Revenue: The total ordered revenue for the analyzed period is $90.73M, with significant contributions from specific SKUs like D08L95YHWO and C182[KZG1].

Correlation Analysis: A scatter plot of views vs. units sold was used to explore the correlation between customer engagement (views) and sales performance (units).

Out-of-Stock Insights: The data highlights 355,875 occurrences of rep OOS, which can impact revenue and customer satisfaction.

Revenue Trends: Revenue and units sold have an upward trend during the analysis period, but SKU-specific performance varies.

## Recommendations

Improve SKU Availability: Focus on reducing out-of-stock occurrences to capture missed sales opportunities and prevent revenue loss.
Enhance Marketing for Low-Performing SKUs: For SKUs with high views but low conversion, consider targeted marketing and promotions to increase sales.
Leverage High-Performing Categories: Prioritize high-performing categories like "1000 Inputs" for expansion and further investment.

## Visualizations

An interactive dashboard was created using Tableau to visualize key metrics like ordered revenue, units sold, views, and SKU performance. The dashboard is available at: Link to Tableau Dashboard

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of e-commerce sales performance and customer engagement. By addressing rep OOS issues and optimizing the conversion of high-view SKUs, brands can unlock new growth opportunities on Amazon and other retailers.
